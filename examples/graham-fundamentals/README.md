This is an example algorithm that shows how you can translate some of the principles Benjamin Graham laid out in his book, The Intelligent Investor, into a script that trades in a live environment.

To connect pylivetrader to your existing Alpaca live or paper account, you can see the full instructions [here](https://github.com/alpacahq/pylivetrader/tree/master/examples).

Once your API keys and URL endpoint have been configured, this algorithm can be run with this command:
```
pylivetrader run GrahamFundamentals.py
```
